# liri-bot-app

OVERVIEW

For this assignment, LIRI was created. Liri is and stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It works in node and takes commands from the user and gives back data.

Liri pulls from APIs from Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB to generate it's response depending on the user's request. 

The user uses four specific commands, depending on what they want.

They are:
- "my-tweets"
- "spotify-this-song"
- "movie-this"
- "do-what-it-says"

TWITTER

"my-tweets" pulls from the Twitter API. In this instance, it'll pull from my dummy Twitter I specifically created for this assignment
